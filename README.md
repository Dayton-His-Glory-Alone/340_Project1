The program is run from the Driver.java class and currently runs exclusively in the console.

Start by launching the Driver.java class. You will prompted to enter the file path for the maze
you want to evaluate. The maze must be .txt file.

The console will then display the maze read in, as to assure the maze displayed is equivalent 
to the maze from the file.

The console will then print the shortest path in the maze as a sequence of coordinates. 
These coordinates are printed in order of start to finish with both the starting and ending 
nodes being part of the list. 

For reading the coordinates, assume that the TOP LEFT corner is (0, 0) and the bottom right 
corner is (MAX, MAX).
