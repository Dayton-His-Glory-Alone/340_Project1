# 340_Project1

Maze solver program using BFS

## Running the Program

The program runs from the excutable jar file.

Start by launching the IT340Project1.jar file. You should be met with a dialog box with a text field to enter the text file.
Once you have finished typing the file path, you press the "Enter" key on your keboard.
If the file path you entered is able to be entered, a "Load" button will apear on the program.
Otherwise, pressing the "Enter" button will not display the "Load" button as the program cannot properly open the file.

After pressing the "Load" button, the program will dispaly the unsolved maze.
The "Start" button will automatically show the the path the program takes in exploring the maze.
Once the animation finishes, the shortest path found by the program will be displayed in a pink color.

Pressing the "Step" button acts similarly to the "Start" button but rather it will only update the display one square at a time.

A label at the bottom right of the program displays the status of the program.

Once the shortest path has been displayed by either the "Start" or "Step" functions, the "Start" and "Step" buttons will be removed and you will be left with only the "Reset" button.

The Reset button can be pressed at any point and will restart the program, allowing you to enter a new text file path.
